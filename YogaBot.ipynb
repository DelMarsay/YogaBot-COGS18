    "This class taught me that it is never too late to push your limits and learn something outside your comfort zone.  I always steered away from learning anything computer related. In fact, I got through my years at community college without even knowing how to use a google doc. That being said, I had zero experience with Python prior to taking this course. I was excited about learning how to code while knowing that it would be challenging. Overall it took me approximately 40+ hours throughout a period of five days to complete this project. It took longer than I had anticipated because I had to rewatch several lectures and I struggled to understand how to write meaningful tests functions for my chatbot.  Working on this project was fun, tedious, time consuming, and challenging (did I mention it was super challenging? üò´). \n",
    "In this project I got to practice refactoring my code which is something I hadn‚Äôt really done before throughout the course. I also learned/discovered how to incorporate an API reference. It was exciting to be able to extract images of yoga poses using something created by someone else! I wanted to make my project as nonbasic as I possibly could given my current knowledge and time I had and I believe I accomplished that. \n",
    "At the end of the last lecture we were asked about our confidence level and future computer programming endeavors. I chose the ‚Äúmiddle‚Äù (mas-o-menos) answer for confidence level and therefore wish to pursue more knowledge...because Python is not only useful but, pretty fun!  "
